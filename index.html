          <p> Welcome to this site</p>

          <p>  The _ADD SITE NAME HERE is a project that takes an interesting look at some social justice issues in the Portland Metropolatian area.
          According to The Atlantic,May 17, 2016, "Can Portland Avoid Repeating San Francisco's Mistakes?", "the city got "discovered, people started flocking here, the tech companies came, and Portland became more expensive.
          Oregon has been the top destination for people to move to for three years in a row."
          Now, housing prices are skyrocketing... more people move in and new high-rises and apartment complexes go up.
          Apartment rents are risig at an annualized rate of 14 percent, one of th largest increases in the country.
